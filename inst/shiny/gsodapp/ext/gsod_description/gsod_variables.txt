GSOD variables, attributes and indices (from https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/GSODR/vignettes/GSODR.html#appendix-1-gsodr-final-data-format-contents-and-units)


TEMP - Mean daily temperature converted to degrees C to tenths. Missing = NA;

TEMP_ATTRIBUTES - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily temperature;

DEWP - Mean daily dew point converted to degrees C to tenths. Missing = NA;

DEWP_ATTRIBUTES - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily dew point;

SLP - Mean sea level pressure in millibars to tenths. Missing = NA;

SLP_ATTRIBUTES - Number of observations used in calculating mean sea level pressure;

STP - Mean station pressure for the day in millibars to tenths. Missing = NA;

STP_ATTRIBUTES - Number of observations used in calculating mean station pressure;

VISIB - Mean visibility for the day converted to kilometres to tenths. Missing = NA;

VISIB_ATTRIBUTES - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily visibility;

WDSP - Mean daily wind speed value converted to metres/second to tenths. Missing = NA;

WDSP_ATTRIBUTES - Number of observations used in calculating mean daily wind speed;

MXSPD - Maximum sustained wind speed reported for the day converted to metres/second to tenths. Missing = NA;

GUST - Maximum wind gust reported for the day converted to metres/second to tenths. Missing = NA;

MAX - Maximum temperature reported during the day converted to Celsius to tenths–time of max temp report varies by country and region, so this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day. Missing = NA;

MAX_ATTRIBUTES - Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit max temp report and not from the ‘hourly’ data. An “*” indicates max temp was derived from the hourly data (i.e., highest hourly or synoptic-reported temperature);

MIN - Minimum temperature reported during the day converted to Celsius to tenths–time of min temp report varies by country and region, so this will sometimes not be the max for the calendar day. Missing = NA;

MIN_ATTRIBUTES - Blank indicates max temp was taken from the explicit min temp report and not from the ‘hourly’ data. An “*” indicates min temp was derived from the hourly data (i.e., highest hourly or synoptic-reported temperature);

PRCP - Total precipitation (rain and/or melted snow) reported during the day converted to millimetres to hundredths; will usually not end with the midnight observation, i.e., may include latter part of previous day. A value of “.00” indicates no measurable precipitation (includes a trace). Missing = NA; Note: Many stations do not report ‘0’ on days with no precipitation– therefore, NA will often appear on these days. For example, a station may only report a 6-hour amount for the period during which rain fell. See FLAGS_PRCP column for source of data;

PRCP_ATTRIBUTES -

A = 1 report of 6-hour precipitation amount;

B = Summation of 2 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;

C = Summation of 3 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;

D = Summation of 4 reports of 6-hour precipitation amount;

E = 1 report of 12-hour precipitation amount;

F = Summation of 2 reports of 12-hour precipitation amount;

G = 1 report of 24-hour precipitation amount;

H = Station reported ‘0’ as the amount for the day (e.g. from 6-hour reports), but also reported at least one occurrence of precipitation in hourly observations–this could indicate a trace occurred, but should be considered as incomplete data for the day;

I = Station did not report any precipitation data for the day and did not report any occurrences of precipitation in its hourly observations–it’s still possible that precipitation occurred but was not reported;

SNDP - Snow depth in millimetres to tenths. Missing = NA;

I_FOG - Indicator for fog, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;

I_RAIN_DRIZZLE - Indicator for rain or drizzle, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;

I_SNOW_ICE - Indicator for snow or ice pellets, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;

I_HAIL - Indicator for hail, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;

I_THUNDER - Indicator for thunder, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;

I_TORNADO_FUNNEL - Indicator for tornado or funnel cloud, (1 = yes, 0 = no/not reported) for the occurrence during the day;

EA - Mean daily actual vapour pressure as calculated using improved August-Roche-Magnus approximation (Alduchov and Eskridge 1996). Missing = NA;

ES - Mean daily saturation vapour pressure as calculated using improved August-Roche-Magnus approximation (Alduchov and Eskridge 1996). Missing = NA;

RH - Mean daily relative humidity as calculated using improved August-Roche-Magnus approximation (Alduchov and Eskridge 1996). Missing = NA.
